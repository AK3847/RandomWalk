Up (move North) - this takes us closer toward [9,1]\n2. Up again - now at [8,1]\n3.

Continuation upwards twice more stays within bounds at [6,4] and then moving into [5,4] while still being cautious not to step off the grid edge as we near it on both axes; hence: UP, RIGHT, right again for a total of three times (now positioned at [8,7]), followed by two more up movements\n6. Finally shifting left twice and then downwards maintains our path within boundaries moving from coordinates ([5,4], now going to the bottom row) with moves: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN\n\nThe sequence above is just a representation of one possible way you could navigate through your specified grid range without stepping out.
